# dash-etf-analysis
### Using various AI models, I've developed a small dashboard that demonstrates a buy-on-dip investment strategy as well as provides short term and long term forecasting using different models.  I've used this project to learn more about developing a python based webpage using Dash and Plotly in addition to using machine learning models from Prophet and scikit-learn.

### I am using the following libraries:
```
dash                        # Core Dash package for building web apps
dash-bootstrap-components** # Bootstrap components for styling Dash apps
dash-table                  # Dash DataTable for displaying tabular data
pandas                      # Data manipulation and analysis
plotly                      # Plotly for interactive visualizations
yfinance                    # Yahoo Finance API for downloading stock data
scikit-learn                # Machine learning models (Linear Regression)
prophet                     # Time series forecasting with Prophet
numpy                       # Numerical operations used in analysis
```
